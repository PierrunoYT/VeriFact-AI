# Introducing VeriFact AI: A New Tool for Information Verification

Hello Reddit community! I'm excited to share a project I've been working on called VeriFact AI. It's a web-based tool designed to help verify information using a combination of AI and search engine results.

## What is VeriFact AI?

VeriFact AI is an application that aims to assist users in fact-checking statements and analyzing images. It's designed for anyone who wants to verify information, from students and researchers to curious individuals.

## Key Features:

* Multiple verification methods (AI, search engine, or combined)
* Image analysis capability
* Support for multiple languages
* User-friendly interface
* Customizable settings

## How It Works:

1. Input a statement to verify
2. Optionally upload an image for context
3. Select your preferred language and verification method

In today's information-rich world, it can be challenging to distinguish fact from fiction. VeriFact AI aims to provide a tool to help users make more informed decisions about the information they encounter.
